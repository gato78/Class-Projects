# Project 3 - PHASE 2

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
<p>The project objective is to implement A star's algorithm to find the shortest path between start and goal nodes.
<p>The implementation will make use of the map for project2 (rigid robot case scenario)
<li>Rigid Robot ( robot radius = r , Obstacle clearance = c)</li>
<li>Additional parameters will be start node theta angle and step size for movement as well as using a threshold goald radius for the simulation as the algorithm will be unlikely to reach exact goal node. 
The implementation code is done using Python 3.

## HOW TO RUN Astar_rigid.py
<p>Python version used:
  <p> Python 3.6.5
<p> Python Libraries needed :
  <p> numpy
  <p> math
  <p> opencv
  <p> matplotlib  
<p> How to run program:
  <p>Open console terminal and run command below:
    <p>python Astar_rigid.py
  <p>Program should then start and ask the user to input start node coordinates and angle, goal node coordinates, obstacles clearance, robot radius and step(distance to move).
  <p>Program will then execute and once data results are obtained it will displayed them as a pygame animation

## Astar_rigid.py EXECUTION TIME :
<p>To execute the algorithm takes about 26.4 seconds
<p>Then the pygame simulation phase takes about 42.1 seconds.
<p>However, the pygame simulation phase includes a delay of 8 seconds purposely added to allow time for the user to see the shortest path display. However, this can be adjusted as needed if a shorter simulation time is required.
<p>In total for complete execution = 26.4 + 42.1 = 68.5 seconds
